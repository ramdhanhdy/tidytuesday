## Alone 

\*dataset description

## Exploratory Data Analysis

First, required packasges are imported

```{r}
#|echo: false 
library(tidyverse)
library(alone)
library(ggtext)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggthemes)
library(showtext)
library(patchwork)
library(DataExplorer)
library(ggstatsplot)
```

Let's see the glimpse of the dataset

```{r}
#| echo: false
glimpse(survivalists)
```

Looks like there are some missing values on several columns, let's explore this further

```{r}
plot_missing(survivalists)
```

```{r}
plot_bar(survivalists)
```

```{r}
#data wrangling
df <- expand_grid(
  days_lasted = sort(unique(survivalists$days_lasted)),
  gender = unique(survivalists$gender)
) |>
  left_join(
    survivalists |>
      count(days_lasted, gender),
    by = c("days_lasted", "gender")
  ) |>
  left_join(
    survivalists |>
      count(gender, name = "N"),
    by = "gender"
  ) |>
  group_by(gender) |>
  mutate(
    n = replace_na(n, 0),
    n_lasted = N-cumsum(n),
    p = n_lasted/N
  )

The Levene's test yielded a result of (p=.997) This indicates that our data met the statistical assumption for homogeneity of variance. The Shapiro-Wilk's test yielded a p-value p<.0001 for the sample as a whole assumption of normality has been violated.
